                        <p>ASD (autism spectrum disorder) affects about 1 in 100 children in the world. This is so important because some people have a difficult time recognizing someone has the disorder and it is important to educate on the topic. Educating people on the topic and spreading awareness for ASD can bring positivity to the community and leave a great impact in people's lives. In recent years, there has been more awareness brought to sight to the public view on the topic of ASD. But, it is still very important to this day to promote acceptance of individuals with autism.</p>
                        <p>Always remembering people with autism have inspirations and goals just like everyone else is one of the first steps to being more accepting towards people with ASD. Also, we can educate ourselves and others of the symptoms of the disorder and how we can mitigate issues when provided with the information. Ways we can educate ourselves are reading different articles on the topic, talking to someone that struggles with the disorder first hand, or even just using social media. </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">How can we help?</h2>
                        <p>We can also help by donating to charity or even working with people that have autism and letting them know that they are accepted and loved for who they are. By doing things to spread awareness, we can get rid of the stigma surrounding autism and help build up the community by increasing awareness for people who have ASD. All in all, doing this will lead to inclusiveness and friendliness surrounding those who have autism spectrum disorder.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Using proper language</h2>
                        <p>Each blog post should include an image and a PDF or a video. Included in the following lines is the code for including an image and a PDF. In the link below, include your pdf. The image is the source, labeled src below. You simply have to follow the directory path to replace the image. The directory path as is is stating you will find this image if you go to assets, then image, and there you will find the image I have called. This must be the exact path. Changing punctutation or capitalization will mean the site cannot find your picture. Remember, machines are incredibly literal.</p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/handstoworld.jpeg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">This is how you add captions under an image. Cite your image here. You may also say something about it, if you like.</span>
                        <p>Just like a quote, you should not leave an image resting there. Say something about what the image does for your site.</p>
                        <p>Finally, you may also include a video. Not every member has to do all three. Choose whether you want a video to cite and unpack or a PDF. If it is a video, you only need to include the video and information about it (your summary). If it is a PDF, you should include a picture.</p>
