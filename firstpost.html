                        <p>Autism is believed to be one of the most researched and most fascinating conditions out of them all. Yet, many do not understand the history of it and how it came to be. Steve Silberman created a TedTalk that understands what people thought the creation of autism was but actually was not. Sula Wolff wrote an article that talks about the early accounts of children with autism, and the understanding of autism.<p>
                        <p>Autism was discovered 60 years ago. And since then it has been vastly researched by multiple researchers who have even written international journals like, The Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders and Autism: the International Journal of Research and Practice.</p>
                        <p>Both of these famous journals have some evidence that proves some kind of link between autism and other disorders. “Wolf Children” were children abandoned in the woods and were believed to be raised by wolves. Victor is an example of this, at 11 or 12 he was found naked and covered in scars in the woods. He was mute. Jean Itard, a French physician who rescued him in hopes to humanize him, created a behavior program in hopes of forming a social attachment, then to eventually induce speech. Eventually he was able to do this and 5 years later Victor was able to express his emotions by different tones of his voice.</p>
                        <p>After Victor, Itard devoted his life to the education of mute children. Wolff also wrote that it helps to improve autism if you are to catch it early in life, there is still no long term prognosis to it. She states, “the increased awareness of teachers, doctors and the general public as well as the widening of the concept have contributed to the fact that far more children are now recognised as having autistic spectrum disorders and the estimated prevalence of “autism” has increased over the years from around 4–5 per 10,000 to around 6 per 1,000 children.”</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Public panic related to an increase in recognized Autism cases</h2>
                        <p>Following Christmas of 2014, 132 kids got measles after visiting Disneyland. Although measles is the one of the most preventable diseases in the world, these kids were not vaccinated against it because their parents were afraid of their children getting autism from it. Even though the British Medical Journal had already claimed that this rumor was simply not true, many parents thought it was worse to have a slight chance of their children's autism than to be protected from measles.</p>
                       
                        <h2 class="section-heading">1940s understanding of Autism</h2>
                        <p>In 1943 Leo Kanner, a child psychiatrist at John Hopkins Hospital, published a paper about some of his patients who would inhabit private worlds and ignore the people around them. They were very good at entertaining themselves but the littlest thing like something in a different place than usual would send them into a panic. He eventually also found that some of the kids had special abilities in certain areas, but dismissed it as something normal. Leo then declared autism was a form of infantile psychosis that was caused by cold unaffectionate parents. Steve Silberman states that:</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote"> “many years later we still believe the “cure” for autism is to be found in understanding teachers, accommodating employers, supportive communities, and parents who have faith in their children's potential.”</blockquote>
                        <p>This was a critical step towards viewing autism as a part of someone and less of a "disease to be treated".</p>
